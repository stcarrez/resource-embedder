# Embedding help and documentation in C

This example shows how to you can embedd help and documentation files
in a C program.  This example uses a `package.xml` definition to
describe the files and the methods to collect and embed the files.
The Advance Resource Embedder scans the directory, runs the `man`
command to obtain the documentation and put the formatted result
in the final C source.  It also collects the pre-defined text documentation
located in the `help` directory.

# Build

Run the command

```
make
```

and this generates:

* src/help.h: header file generated by *are* with files in `help/*.txt`,
* src/help.c: embedded documentation file generated by *are* with `help/*.txt`,
* src/man.h: header file generated by *are* with man pages from `man/*`,
* src/man.c: embedded documentation file generated by *are* with `man/*`,
* show-help: binary that prints the documentation

The program usage is then:

```
show-help
show-help ls
show-help edit
```
